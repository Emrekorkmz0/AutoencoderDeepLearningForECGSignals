# Introduction

Electrocardiograms (EKGs) are widely used for monitoring cardiac activity. However, raw EKG data is often high-dimensional and noisy, making feature extraction a critical preprocessing step. This project employs an autoencoder, a type of neural network, to extract meaningful features from EKG data. These features are lower-dimensional representations that capture the essential information in the signal.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of EKG signals. Each signal has been preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. Details of the dataset preprocessing steps are provided in the code.

Methodology

Autoencoder Architecture:

The autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder.

The encoder compresses the input EKG signal into a latent representation.

The decoder reconstructs the signal from the latent representation.

Training:

The model is trained using mean squared error (MSE) as the reconstruction loss.

The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

Feature Extraction:

Once trained, the encoder part of the autoencoder is used to extract features from the EKG signals.
